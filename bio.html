        Ethan Pailes is a Junior at Tufts University, where he is majoring in
        Computer Science. He finds complex systems in general, and computers
        in particular - with their instant gratification -
        to be endlessly fascinating.

        If Ethan is not studying or hacking together his most recent
        hair-brained idea in an esoteric language he just installed, he
        can often be found in a gi practicing Karate.
        His interest in martial arts probably arose from watching one too
        may Cantonese language kung-fu films.
