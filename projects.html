      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
      Byte Blocks is a low level data description language which allows
      users to define a structured data format using a simple syntax
      with an obvious correspondence to the on-disk representation of
      data. The byte blocks compiler, written in Haskell, generates
      C headers which contain generated parsers and serializers for
      the Byte Blocks definitions. It is straightforward to define a
      make rule which smoothly integrates Byte Blocks into any existing
      C code base.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The Byte Blocks compiler currently generates between 100
      and 300 lines of C for every 10 lines of Byte Blocks. This code
      expansion serves as both an indication of the increased expressiveness
      that Byte Blocks offers and the inevitable result of code generation.
      </p>
      <p>
      Though Byte Blocks currently only targets C it is conceived as
      a language independent data format. Adding support for a new target
      language is as simple as adding a new module to the compiler.
      </p>

      <h4>Related Work</h4>
      <p>
      Byte Blocks drew architectural inspiration from
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/?hl=en">
        Google Protobufs</a>. The
      <a href="http://pads.cs.tufts.edu/papers/icdt11.pdf">PADS language</a>
      is an EDSL hosted in several languages which focuses on ad-hoc data
      description using declarative forms. Byte Blocks tries to join
      PADS's ad hoc data descriptive ability with the language independent
      architecture of Google Protobufs. Both of these projects are more
      mature than Byte Blocks and most likely represent better choices
      for serious work at this point.

      Wikipedia provides all of its source text in large archive files,
      and this project represents my flirtation with using python to
      scrape the text data for interesting facts. I a python script
      in a batch manner to filter out all the articles which looked like
      they were about universities. A <a href="https://github.com/ethanpailes/wiki_parsing/blob/master/universities/extract_info.py">second script</a>
      ran over the reduced
      dataset to pull out location and data information about each university.
      The results were <a href="https://github.com/ethanpailes/wiki_parsing/blob/master/universities/output/wiki_universities.png">graphed</a>
      using R.

      After I finished my course on Programming Languages I felt that I
      did not really understand monads well enough. The solution seemed
      to be learning Haskell. This project was the result of that impulse
      along with a healthy mistrust of anything involving too much arithmetic.
      I did not end up learning about monads, but this was my Haskell "Hello
      World." The project currently only solves puzzles which are hard coded
      into the source. To be useful it requires a parser, which I may even
      write one of these days.
