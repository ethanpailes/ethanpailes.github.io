      Ethan Pailes is a Junior at Tufts University, where he is majoring in
      Computer Science. He finds complex systems in general, and computers
      in particular - with their instant gratification -
      to be endlessly facinating.

      If Ethan is not studdying or hacking together his most recent
      hair-brained idea in an esoteric langauge he just installed, he
      can often be found in a gi practicing Karate.
      His interest in martial args probably arose from watching one too
      may Cantoneese langauge kung-fu films.
